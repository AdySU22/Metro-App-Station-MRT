# Metro-App-Station-MRT

This project models a transportation network using a graph data structure, specifically tailored for MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) systems. It defines a Vertex class to represent stations and their connections using an adjacency list. The project supports adding stations and connections (edges) between them. It incorporates Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths between stations, which is useful for route planning. Additionally, it includes a linked list-based scheduling system to manage and display transportation events, and uses bubble sort to organize events by departure time. The terminal-based user interface allows users to interact with the system, view the station network, and calculate the shortest routes between stations. Overall, this project provides a comprehensive solution for managing and analyzing MRT transportation networks.
